# Blog: Next.js + Strapi 

A production-ready blog built with **Nextjs 14** (App Router, RSC) and **Strapi CMS** configured to host files in a S3 Bucket

Live example at: [blog.bmariano.me](https://blog.bmariano.me)

## Important:

It's optional to add the AWS S3 variables, the deployment will complete, but the files will be saved in the deployment file system, therefore, if you update or redeploy the Strapi Admin, **the files will be lost**.

To make Strapi host the files in a S3 Bucket, [follow the instructions of this post](https://blog.bmariano.me/posts/1).
